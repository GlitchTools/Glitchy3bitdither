Glitchy 3 Bit Dither
==============
Implemented by Nolan Caudill, "Enhanced" by JKircharz

<p>Originally, Nolan Caudill's demo used two different error-diffusion dithering algorithms: <a href="http://verlagmartinkoch.at/software/dither/index.html">Atkinson's</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering">Floyd-Steinberg</a>. Now it does more. So much more. ( Insert maniacal laughter )

<p>This runs completely client-side, using the FileReader and canvas APIs. If you have a decent browser, this could work. Also, you can right-click and save the result of the processing.</p>

The demo lives <a href="http://jkirchartz.com/Glitchy3bitdither/">here</a>.
